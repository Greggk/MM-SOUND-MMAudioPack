PREAMBLE

This package contains the MP3 support module (MMIOProc) from Russell O'Conner's 
MMAudioPak. The MMIOProc includes updates and fixes by Gregg Young.

Since ArcaOS (v5 and later) already includes the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC 
support modules, ArcaOS users generally only require the MP3 module.

The installation scripts have been modified by Alex Taylor from Russell's 
original release in order to install only the MP3 support files.  

Gregg Young updated the MMIOProc to libmad 0.15.1b and modified the MP3
identification code to more accurately identify MP3s.
